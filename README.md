Overview
This repository contains Python code for clustering country data using a specified methodology. The goal is to group countries into clusters, and in this specific case, we aim to create 2 clusters. Additionally, the analysis explores the impact of trying different numbers of clusters, with a particular focus on testing with 7 clusters.

Data Source
The country data used for this clustering analysis is sourced from a dataset containing comprehensive information about various countries.

Instructions
Clustering Methodology:
Utilize the methodology presented in the lecture to group all the countries into 2 clusters initially.

Experiment with Cluster Numbers:
Try different numbers of clusters, such as 7, and observe how the data is grouped.

Plotting the Data:
Use the c parameter in the plotting function to visually separate the data by the defined clusters. This parameter represents color in the plot.

Running the Code
Clone this repository and execute the provided Python script to perform the clustering analysis on the country data. Ensure you have the required libraries installed by using:


pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Explore Different Cluster Numbers
Feel free to experiment with various numbers of clusters to observe how the data is segmented. The color-coded plots will visually represent the grouping of countries based on the selected number of clusters.

Data Source
The country data used in this project is comprehensive and offers a holistic view of various attributes related to different countries.
